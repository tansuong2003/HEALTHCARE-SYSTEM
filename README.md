A Healthcare insurance company is facing challenges in increasing revenue and customer insights

They wanted to ask Big Data Ecosystem for help to analyze their competitor company's data received from various sources, specifically through scrapped sources and third-party sources.

This analysis will help them track customer behavior and status to customize insurance policy purchase incentives for them and also calculate royalties and care for customers who have purchased policies in the past. which will thereby increase their revenue.
